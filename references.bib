abstract = {Emerging Multicore SoC SmartNICs, enclosing rich computing resources (e.g., a multicore processor, onboard DRAM, accelerators, programmable DMA engines), hold the potential to offload generic datacenter server tasks. However, it is unclear how to use a SmartNIC efficiently and maximize the offloading benefits, especially for distributed applications. Towards this end, we characterize four commodity SmartNICs and summarize the offloading performance implications from four perspectives: traffic control, computing capability, onboard memory, and host communication.Based on our characterization, we build iPipe, an actor-based framework for offloading distributed applications onto SmartNICs. At the core of iPipe is a hybrid scheduler, combining FCFS and DRR-based processor sharing, which can tolerate tasks with variable execution costs and maximize NIC compute utilization. Using iPipe, we build a real-time data analytics engine, a distributed transaction system, and a replicated key-value store, and evaluate them on commodity SmartNICs. Our evaluations show that when processing 10/25Gbps of application bandwidth, NIC-side offloading can save up to 3.1/2.2 beefy Intel cores and lower application latencies by 23.0/28.0 μs.},

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

abstract = {High-performance distributed transactions require efficient remote operations on database memory and protocol metadata. The high communication cost of this workload calls for hardware acceleration. Recent research has applied RDMA to this end, leveraging the network controller to manipulate host memory without consuming CPU cycles on the target server. However, the basic read/write RDMA primitives demand trade-offs in data structure and protocol design, limiting their benefits. SmartNICs are a flexible alternative for fast distributed transactions, adding programmable compute cores and on-board memory to the network interface. Applying measured performance characteristics, we design Xenic, a SmartNIC-optimized transaction processing system. Xenic applies an asynchronous, aggregated execution model to maximize network and core efficiency. Xenic's co-designed data store achieves low-overhead remote object accesses. Additionally, Xenic uses flexible, point-to-point communication patterns between SmartNICs to minimize transaction commit latency. We compare Xenic against prior RDMA- and RPC-based transaction systems with the TPC-C, Retwis, and Smallbank benchmarks. Our results for the three benchmarks show 2.42x, 2.07x, and 2.21x throughput improvement, 59\%, 42\%, and 22\% latency reduction, while saving 2.3, 8.1, and 10.1 threads per server.},

abstract = {Network monitoring has been evolving over several years to be able to identify and react to issues at a faster rate to reduce network downtime. With the expansion of cloud-users and the need for higher networking capability, the deployments are vast and complex, constantly making network troubleshooting slower. In this paper, we introduce a novel network monitoring and troubleshooting architecture that is user-defined, allowing users to define their troubleshooting profiles for a network device. We introduce the framework that can be easily integrated with the network device operating system which can work either independently on the device or can be aggregated across multiple devices in a network deployment. We present use-cases where this device-level telemetry abstraction would be very useful and how it can be easily extended. Also, we describe the machine-learning aspect which predicts thresholds based on data patterns, thus automating responses when an anomalous event occurs. Finally, we analyze the footprint the framework would have on a real network device and its overall benefit for the network in terms of latency and reaction time.},

abstract = {Network telemetry is essential for administrators to monitor massive data traffic in a network-wide manner. Existing telemetry solutions often face the dilemma between resource efficiency (i.e., low CPU, memory, and bandwidth overhead) and full accuracy (i.e., error-free and holistic measurement). We break this dilemma via a network-wide architectural design OmniMon, which simultaneously achieves resource efficiency and full accuracy in flow-level telemetry for large-scale data centers. OmniMon carefully coordinates the collaboration among different types of entities in the whole network to execute telemetry operations, such that the resource constraints of each entity are satisfied without compromising full accuracy. It further addresses consistency in network-wide epoch synchronization and accountability in error-free packet loss inference. We prototype OmniMon in DPDK and P4. Testbed experiments on commodity servers and Tofino switches demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniMon over state-of-the-art telemetry designs.},

abstract = {In-band network telemetry (INT) is an emerging network monitoring framework based on a protocol-independent packet processor (P4). Network devices can be programmed with a domain-specific language to embed switch-internal states into data packets as they traverse through networks. However, the current P4-based INT does not support a sampling; thus, INT headers should be augmented for all incoming packets, which will incur high overhead in a large-scale network. In this paper, we propose a flexible sampling-based INT (FS-INT) scheme to address the aforementioned issues. Simulation results show that FS-INT can reduce the protocol overhead in a controlled manner while providing sufficiently high accuracy.}

abstract = {We report on experiences with Swift congestion control in Google datacenters. Swift targets an end-to-end delay by using AIMD control, with pacing under extreme congestion. With accurate RTT measurement and care in reasoning about delay targets, we find this design is a foundation for excellent performance when network distances are well-known. Importantly, its simplicity helps us to meet operational challenges. Delay is easy to decompose into fabric and host components to separate concerns, and effortless to deploy and maintain as a congestion signal while the datacenter evolves. In large-scale testbed experiments, Swift delivers a tail latency of <50μs for short RPCs, with near-zero packet drops, while sustaining ~100Gbps throughput per server. This is a tail of <3x the minimal latency at a load close to 100\%. In production use in many different clusters, Swift achieves consistently low tail completion times for short RPCs, while providing high throughput for long RPCs. It has loss rates that are at least 10x lower than a DCTCP protocol, and handles O(10k) incasts that sharply degrade with DCTCP.},
